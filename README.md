# burritojs

Create and authorize your application the same way you would a burrito. This
library is very much based on how you'd order a burrito at Chipotle. Due to this
you may run into certain scenarios where you need to either double wrap or even
rewrap your authorization layer.

The general idea here is that authorization scopes are like burrito ingredients.
You are only authorized to access the scope you have selected and can only
choose from those which are available.

Note: This application does not handle authentication.
